# DeepSurv-Cancer-Survival-Analysis
DeepSurv-based survival analysis for cancer progression (METABRIC dataset)

This repository contains the implementation of a DeepSurv-based survival analysis framework for cancer progression prediction using the METABRIC dataset.

## Features
- DeepSurv neural survival model
- Comparison with CoxPH, RSF, and Survival-SVM
- Autoencoder-based feature learning
- Integrated Brier Score and time-dependent AUC evaluation
- Kaplan–Meier risk stratification


## Dataset
The METABRIC dataset can be obtained from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunesevitan/breast-cancer-metabric

## Usage
See `run_instructions.txt` for step-by-step instructions to reproduce the experiments.
